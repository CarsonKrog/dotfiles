Backman's ACM Vim talk


 ------------------------------
 things i should use more often
 ------------------------------
yk or dk / yj or dj more often
 -> this would either yank or delete the line I am on and the line above or below
 -> then i wouldn't have to go into visual mode and delete/yank the 2 lines that i want

c
-> change puts you into insert mode after deleting something

I 
-> insert at the beginning of the first non - white space

:!<shell cmd>
-> when in vim type :!pwd to run a shell script from inside vim

control r is redo

*
-> find next instance of word under cursor


vim file1 file2 -p
-> open the files in tabs 


maybe look into marks?
